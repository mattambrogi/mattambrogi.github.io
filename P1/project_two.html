                    change my career path, and set out to learn a whole new set of skills.

                <h2 class="mt-5">Part 1: A School Project</h2>
                <h3 class="mt-5">A Thought</h3>
                <p> During the spring of my Junior Year in college I took a transformative course. Through an honors program
                    I participated in, I was paired with a team and given the whole semester to develop an idea for a product,
                    service, or organization. The only constraint was that this idea would solve an important problem. The
                    professor had a background in psychology and class time was used to teach us how to think about and spot
                    problems. Outside of that class, I was studying Mechanical Engineering. My course load was tough and
                    although I struggled to make time, I went to office hours for a few of my classes every week. Making
                    room in my schedule to get onto campus and wait in a long queue of students was painful. But it was a
                    necessity due to the amount of time it saved me when compared with trying, on my own, to find where I
                    went wrong in a page of numbers and symbols. I had a few friends who were a year above me in Engineering
                    and when I ran into them I always jumped on the opportunity to pull out my homework and ask a question.
                    Generally, they could answer it quickly. Coincidentally, I had been trying to make money on campus and
                    found it nearly impossible. I couldn’t block out enough time to be at a job on a regular basis. I also
                    knew from a past project I did with The Office for Student Employment that demand far outstripped supply
                    for on-campus jobs. One day, these ideas clicked together. I thought, what if I could click and button
                    and always have a friend to ask a question?
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">The Product</h2>
                <p>
                    I introduced this idea at my next team meeting and it resonated with everyone. We imagined a student like me:

                </p>
                <p>


                    It’s Sunday night. He’s sitting at his desk going crazy over Differential Equations Homework. There’s an exam in two weeks
                    and he doesn’t understand the new material at all. He could rush to office hours in the morning before
                    class, but there’s a much better option. He pulls out his phone, opens an app, selects the class and
                    send out a request in the form of a short problem description or a photo of the homework. Soon he gets
                    connected through a video chat with someone else at our school who has taken the same course. When they
                    are done, the tutor gets paid directly through the app and both gotten something valuable.
                    <p>
                        That was the initial vision. The goal was to take this idea, test it, make it better, and get it ready for a hypothetical
                        Venture Capital pitch. The product would be called HeadsTogether.

                    </p>

                    Here’s what our first digital mockups ended up looking like.

                </p>
                <div class="d-inline m-5">
                    <img src="heads_photo_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" alt="Responsive image" style=" width: 35%;">
                    <img src="heads_photo_2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" alt="Responsive image" style=" width: 35%;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now, we needed to validate whether this was a good idea. First, we asked, “Does anything similar exist?” Second, “Does anyone
                    want this?”
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Contextual Research</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of online tutoring products. But, at the time, none were truly on demand, peer to peer, and localized; the
                    product we envisioned. We would be the first service to connect students with others who had taken the
                    exact same course as them not just someone who knew the general subject. We knew from experience and
                    interviews this was what student’s wanted. We envisioned a UI far more intuitive than any that existed.
                    We would focus 100% on helping people connect digitally, as opposed to in person. This would allow us
                    to focus on a single great experience. Also, we would allow students to get help by the minute, so even
                    if they just had one question, our experience would be low friction enough for their use. This chart
                    shows how we saw ourselves in comparison to competitors.
                </p>

                    <img src="strategy.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" alt="Responsive image" style=" width: 75%;">
                </div>

                <h2 class="mt-5">User Research</h2>
                <p>
                    After a lot of debate over wording and question order, we developed a survey and distributed it to about 100 students. We
                    supplemented this with a handful of one on one interviews. It turned out, students really wanted something
                    like this, especially within certain disciplines like engineering. Tutor supply looked equally promising.
                    Many students wanted a way to make money on their own time without doing something they thought was inconvenient
                    or embarrassing, such as driving for Uber.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also heard a lot of hesitation. “But what about x.” Or, “I’d like this, but to be honest I can’t imagine doing y.” We
                    collected all that feedback and used it to refine our idea.

                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                    We went from paper mockups to digital prototypes through a series of iterations. We had make users play with and critique
                    our designs until felt they were really good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We knew design was less about what our product looked like and more about how it worked. We put a lot of thought into this
                    starting at the highest level. When a user made a request, available tutors for their class would get
                    a ping and then be able to make a bid with an hourly rate. Students could see bids, view profiles, and
                    choose a tutor. At the end of a session a tutor would get paid prorated by the hour. We spent even more
                    time on niche user concerns. Some of the things we worked through were:
                </p>


                <p>
                    What if a student just has one quick question?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do we get an initial base to match supply and demand?

                </p>
                <p>
                    How do we, or is it our responsibility, to discourage cheating?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do we inspire trust in a stranger?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if a student isn’t satisfied with the help they get?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created what an Implications Wheel to help us think through all the edge cases that I won’t go into here. Essentially,
                    a map of what ifs and buts.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Making Money</h2>
                <p>
                    To make money we would take 20% of each interaction on our platform. A mentor of ours who started a company on campus had
                    got his first 10,000 users (30% of the student body) just by advertising in chalk on the sidewalks. This
                    sounded too optimistic, but with a good product we estimated we could eventually get 10% of students
                    to become users. Use would be sporadic, probably a lot around exams and very little at the beginning
                    of the semester. A very rough estimate was that the average user would use this once a month during the
                    school year, or eight times a year. We imagined that used it for a session that cost $15. If so, the
                    product would generate
                </p>
                <p>
                    30,000 students * 0.10 users * 8 uses * $15 per use = $360,000 per Year
                </p>
                <p>
                    Out of that, our company’s revenue would be 360,000 * 0.2 = $72,000
                </p>
                <p>
                    $72,000 is not a lot, but we were excited. This number seemed feasible and our research indicated that if the product was
                    good enough, maybe a lot more than 10% of people would use it. Especially because the students who most
                    wanted it - STEM Majors - compromised a huge percentage of the University. That’s just one campus. It
                    could be scaled to dozens then hundreds of schools. Other revenue streams like ads could be developed
                    as well. There would be upfront costs, but most of the work could be bootstrapped by talented students.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Wrapping it Up</h2>
                <p>
                    We put this all together into a presentation, and got a good grade. More importantly, we had developed the idea of HeadsTogether
                    from scratch. They say execution is everything, but you first need to imagine to learn that. I learned
                    a lot, but I couldn’t get the idea out of my head. I thought it could work and I loved the process we
                    had gone through. I had never been so excited about a project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got a taste of user research, design, and product market fit. More importantly I learned two things that would change the
                    rest of my college career: I loved thinking about products and I had to learn how to program.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Part 2: Pursuing Product</h2>
                <h2 class="mt-5">A New Major</h2>
                <p>
                    The following summer, I worked at a small start-up. When I could, I took on product based work and slowly started asking
                    myself how I could get more exposure in this space. I hadn’t learned about Product Management until the
                    end of the spring when an alumni came and spoke to my class. I remember thinking “people get paid to
                    do this??”
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a lot of research and thought, I left Mechanical Engineering and started my fall semester Senior Year (although I had
                    just bought myself an extra fall at school) taking classes for my new major: Product Management. Maryland
                    has a small program through which students can create their own major and I was determined to get in.
                    I designed a curriculum for my last year and a half consisting of coursework in Computer Science, Design,
                    Analytics, and Writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the best academic decision I ever made. Thereafter, I could take classes I was excited to work at. I worked on a variety
                    of design and programming projects after that and even went through another Product Development exercise
                    for my capstone project.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Revisiting HeadsTogether as a Learning Tool</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to try to launch the product but I couldn’t commit the time. I couldn’t program myself, didn’t know anyone who could
                    help, and was too busy to recruit. The project had come to an end. This motivated me - if I couldn’t
                    make a company out of it, I would learn from it. I later revisited the project from both the design and
                    programming side.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I used a design class I took as chance to remake the product with a cleaner UI and teach myself design software in the process.
                    Classmates gave me more feedback on the product and inspired me to completely reimagine certain features.
                    I learned huge amounts about user research and the design process as a whole that I would use in future
                    projects. Here’s a few screens from that redesign
                </p>
                <div class=" block m-5">
                    <img src="re_design.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" alt="Responsive image" style=" width: 100%;">

                </div>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    I was especially motivated to learn Computer Science. My Mechanical Engineering background made me a technical person and
                    one that was very frustrated by not having the ability to program the product I envisioned. I started
                    with Introduction to Object Oriented Programming right after deciding to create my own major. In the
                    Spring I took my first web development class. We had the semester to work on a basic MVP of a web app
                    for a real client and has a few MBA’s come in and pitch ideas. I asked my instructor if I could pitch
                    mine and ended up getting a team of five students to work with me. This was a one credit course, so our
                    bandwidth was low, but I got to see how a product like this might function and got to experience working
                    with engineers, using Git for collaboration. We made a very rough prototype using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                    and Angular. Later, I had some free time and wanted to improve web development skills. I put myself through
                    a three wee ”boot camp” where I worked on 3 different projects. During the last week, I came back to
                    HeadsTogether and developed an improved UI for our MVP. I learned all about what was required technically
                    to build the product. How to use a database to hold user information, connect that with the app to populate
                    classes and tutors, to use API’s to simplify development, and to redesign the product to make it easier
                    to build. For example, I realized that screen sharing as opposed to a video chat would both be easier
                    technically and a better user experience much of the time. The spark this project lit inside me inspired
                    me to go on to take classes and teach myself much more programing.

                    Here's two screens from the prototype I developed. It was inspired by Airbnb and Facebook's login pages.

                    There was a time after we first finished this project where there was nothing I wanted more than to start this company. That
                    would have been an amazing experience but it simply wasn’t possible for me at the time. Still, I learned
                    more from this one project over a year and a half than I could have imagined. This project inspired me
                    to create my own major, get an internship and job in Product Management, and to learn how to design and program.
                    I’m still working on all these things. Everyone seems to get there in a different way, but this project
                    is how I found product.
