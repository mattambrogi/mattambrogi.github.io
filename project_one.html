                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> Fall 2018, I came across a peice of research that concluded that American's donate far less to charity than
                    they feel they actually should. The numbers said that while Americans felt that they should donate around
                    6% of their salary, the actual number fell closer to 3%. This gap is equivalent to a $250B loss in potential
                    donations. I immediately wondered, what could help close this gap?
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">The Problem</h2>
                <p> I observed that donations are a haphazard business. They tend to be done sporadically with a fair deal of
                    randomness, based on marketing, in who the recipient organization is. I began to imagine a central hub
                    for donations. If it was as easy to keep track of and make donations to charitable organizations as something
                    like Robinhood has made it invest in public corporations, maybe more people would do it more frequently.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Capstone</h2>
                <p>
                    It was my last semester at school and, consequently, I had to submit a Capstone Project. I decided to run with the donations
                    idea and made my capstone a Product Case Study exploring a potential digital solutation for this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was a fun way for me to synthesize the many things I had learned about product management, design, and computer
                    science. I went through the design thinking process conducting research, devloping prototypes, interviewing
                    potential users, and iterating utilizing their feedback. I also put together a rough business plan and
                    explained how this product would be developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this sounds interesting, take a look at my Capstone Report in which I go into far more detail.
