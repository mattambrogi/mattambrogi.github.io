                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    During my undergraduate computer science classes, we learned some really cool stuff. We covered algorithms, data strucutres, and object-oritented programming. 
                    I loved all that. I walked away and patted myself on the back for a job well done. It wasn't till a few months later that I came to the realization that Java was close to useless on it's own.
                    I had no idea how to tie code into something that a user could interact with on the internet. So, I did a couple projects to teach myself how.

                <h3>
                    Crypto Calculator
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first project I did was a calculator which could tell a user how much money their crypto investment had made them. I had been playing around 
                    with some Bitcoin and would compulsively check how much money I had made or lost. But I hated having to go through dual-verification to login to my 
                    account. Instead, I would usually look up the current price and, knowing how much I bought it for and the quantity I had, do a back of the envelope calculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made a web app for that purpose which pulls current price from an api. You can check it out below.

                    Rental Listing Rating
                </h3>
                <p>
                    One summer in college, I worked at a Property Management Startup. We noticed that a lot of online rental listings had terrible descriptions. The CEO talked about
                    developing a tool to rate them. Using a sentiment analysis library and some admittedly arbitrary logic, I made one.
